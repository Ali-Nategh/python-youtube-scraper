This is a small practice project for web scraping with BeautifulSoup.

It gets a keyword from the user, searches that on youtube, and brings back some information of the top 20 videos on the search results.

This includes:

```
Channel name
Video title
Subscribers count
Channel link
```

Ofcourse this is probably not gonna last long, a small change in the youtube results page (the scripts tags and html elements) will break it, but it was a good learning project.

Hope by the time youre reading this it still works and you can use it.
Have a good day!
